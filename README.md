# FlowNet

Draw a flow network, including the edges and nodes. For now, this app can only draw graphs.
But soon it will be merged with: [gca](https://github.com/babudabu/gca) for calculating the flow max.

Note that the capacity for now of each edge is: 1.

You can check the app in this link: [FlowNet](https://flownet.herokuapp.com/).

To use this app, you need to install react. Use the command: npm install and enjoy.
